DirectShow samples
------------------

The following samples demonstrate the use of Microsoft DirectShow
to render, play, and manipulate Windows Media content.

NOTE: Because these samples use DirectShow headers and libraries,
you must have installed the DirectX 8.1 SDK (or later)
in order to properly build the samples.
